# Turing-Machine
Custom panels for the Music Thing Modular - Turing Machine as so kindly made available by Tom Whitwell.
Both the panels for the Turing Machine, as well as the expander, have mirrored chaos to order patterns in the front copper layer.

These panels can be manufactured at any PCB house, but there is a mark on the back to use with JCLPCB's free 'specify location' option for the production number.
